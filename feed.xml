Yet, alongside these advancements are evident energy and communication limitations that restricted the devices to transmit only highly-compressed data. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in situations where devices operate outside of traditional infrastructure, relying on satellite-based communication or variable power sources such as solar energy.</p> <p>Topological Signal Compression (“TSC”) is our answer to deploying sensor networks in these restrictive conditions. TSC is a topology-based, lossy compression method that can be tailored to individual power or bandwidth needs. It allows the transmission of compressed signals that exploit the full range of a variable communications budget, ensuring optimized data transmission under any constraints.</p> <p>The algorithm works by pairing critical points in the signal modality and considering the pairing to be a simplex (this a generalization of a triangle) in a larger simplical complex. In the case of a 1-D modality these simplices are just line segments. As critical pairs are formed they are said to have a lifespan (the time between a simplex being “born” and then merged). This lifespan is called the feature’s “persistence”. Those features with greater persistence are assumed to be the most important features and are retained by TSC. The low persistence features are removed from the signal - this is the lossy part of TSC.</p> <p>I encourage you to read the full <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10115654">paper</a> for more detail. It is a great application of topological data analysis! The Arxiv preprint is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07486.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>To validate our algorithm’s capabilities, we conducted entropy calculations and ran a classification experiment on increasingly simplified signals. We drew these from the robust Free-Spoken Digit Dataset and explored the stability of our technique’s performance against conventional benchmarks. Our tests have proven successful, demonstrating that our innovative algorithm not only handles variable, challenging conditions with grace but also greatly enhances the operational efficiency of IoT devices.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/compression_ex.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> An audio sample at various degrees of compression. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using the topology of a time series for lossy compression.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Using Topology to Track Ocean Patterns</title><link href="https://samvoisin.github.io/blog/2022/tda-tracking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using Topology to Track Ocean Patterns"/><published>2022-09-27T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-09-27T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://samvoisin.github.io/blog/2022/tda-tracking</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://samvoisin.github.io/blog/2022/tda-tracking/"><![CDATA[<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/ocean-of-things">Ocean of Things</a> program organized by DARPA, my team was tasked with developing new methods for oceanographers to track relatively small - or “submesoscale” - oceanographic phenomena like eddies (i.e. vortices in the ocean). You can read the full paper <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2022GL099416">here</a>.</p> <p>This problem is challenging because large oceanographic simulations of high resolution (1-5 sq km) can contain an immense number of eddies - some of which are found inside larger eddies! Identifying these eddies isn’t too hard thanks to previous work from the oceanography community. Simultaneously, tracking each of them through time, however, was much harder.</p> <p>To solve this multi-object tracking problem, we applied tools from topological data analysis (“TDA”) to identify and track these eddies. TDA allows us to quickly identify features on scalar fields and then efficiently associate these features between time steps. Doing this for many time steps creates a set of track segments that can be chronologically ordered to determine the speed and direction of a feature between any two time steps or in aggregate over the life of that feature.</p> <p>In our case the fields are generated from large simulations of oceanic activity. We calculate a scalar measure of vorticity at all points in the simulation to get our scalar field. We identify critical points in this field as vortices and track them as they are generated and dissipate. The image below depicts a few vortices (the blue contours) and their paths (red line segments) in the Gulf of Mexico</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/tft_fig2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Identified and tracked submesoscale eddies </div> <p>Our research can be used for remediating pollution, predicting harmful algal blooms and informing search and rescue missions.
