Welcome to my website! My name is Sam Voisin. I am a data science, machine learning and software design professional. I have extensive experience in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), time series analysis and Bayesian methods.

ü¶æ I am passionate about intuitive, gesture-based control systems. I am currently developing [GestuReMote](https://github.com/samvoisin/gesture-control), a python library which provides an interface for controlling your desktop/laptop with physical gestures.

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Another project I am working on is [AIDM](https://github.com/samvoisin/ai-dungeon-master), an LLM-powered chatbot that can act as a virtual "Game Master" for tabletop role-playing games. AIDM utilizes a combination of prompt engineering and software engineering features to ensure LLM produces appropriate text.

‚õµÔ∏è I currently work as a Senior Data Scientist at Tradewind Data Science where I build value for clients by developing inferential and predictive models to guide strategy and policy decisions.

I graduated from Duke University with a [Master's in Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) in 2020. While at Duke, I made sure to gain exposure to a broad range of fields that are relevant to data science. In addition to probability and statistics courses provided by the Department of Statistical Science, I took courses in algorithms, advanced linear algebra, topology, high-dimensional data analysis and [topological data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) ("TDA"). My master's thesis *Graph Diffusion for Gesture Classification* focused on developing techniques to improve the accuracy of systems that classify physical gestures.

When I'm not thinking about computers I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, learning new skills, and traveling!
