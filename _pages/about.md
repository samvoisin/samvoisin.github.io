I am Sam Voisin. I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [Tradewind Data Science](https://www.tradewinddatascience.com/) where I build value for clients using a wide range of statistical inference and machine learning techniques.

My personal data science interest is intuitive, [gesture-based control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesture_recognition). My current passion project is [GestuReMote](https://github.com/samvoisin/gesture-control), a python library for controlling your machine with computer vision.

I graduated from Duke University with a [Master's in Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) in 2020. While at Duke, I made sure to gain exposure to a broad range of fields that are relevant to data science. In addition to probability and statistics courses provided by the Department of Statistical Science, I took courses in algorithms, advanced linear algebra, topology, high-dimensional data analysis and [topological data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) ("TDA"). My master's thesis *Graph Diffusion for Gesture Classification* focused on developing techniques to improve the accuracy of systems that classify physical gestures.

When I'm not thinking about data I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, learning new skills, and traveling!
